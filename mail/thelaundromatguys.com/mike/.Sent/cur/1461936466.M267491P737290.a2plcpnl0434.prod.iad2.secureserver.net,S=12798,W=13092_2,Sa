<br>
Thank you for speaking with me the other day regarding the sale of EZ Wash in Newark.&nbsp; Can you please provide me with the percentage of the water bill that Orlando is currently paying and when you expect to switch over to the submeters?&nbsp; There are a few interested buyers, one in particular who I expect to make an offer as soon as I can give him an idea of what his rent terms will be.&nbsp; Here is a little backround on the buyer and what i see his plans are for the laundromat:<br>
<br>
- He is an attorney and a cash buyer.<br>
- He will be offering somewhere arounf $250-350k for the business.<br>
- Immediate expenses to get the laundromat where it needs to be will include but not limited to replacing (18) 20lb washers which are currently not working, repairing all out of order washers and dryers, cleaning/painting, new counter area, replacing light fixtures with LEDs, new signage inside and out, replacing ceiling tiles, etc.&nbsp; I estimate the cost of the upfront work to be $125-$150k.<br>
- The remaining washers/dryers are 13+ years old and will need to be replaced in the next 3-5 years depending on cost of repairs.&nbsp; This will be inevitable as any equipment has a reasonable lifespan of 15-20 years.&nbsp; Estimated cost of equipment alone will be in the $600-$700k range.<br>
- Any buyer investing this amount of money is going to need a long term lease to protect their investment, as well as the equipment comany requires it in order to obtain financing.<br>
- After analyzing the current net profit, including potential growth under new management along with improvements both cosmetically and equipment, the total rent for this store will need to be in the $7000-$8000 (total) range for it to make sense for the new tenant and ensure long term success.&nbsp; This would equate to approx. $21-$24 sq. ft. in year one.<br>
- Most investors will be looking for a minimum 10 year lease with 2 or 3 five yr options.<br>
<br>
Thank you for your time and please let me know your thoughts asap as the buyer is anxious to move forward.<br>
