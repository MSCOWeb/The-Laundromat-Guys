  I understand Vinny.=C2=A0 We would be willing to have you sign a non-excl=
usive
agreement, that isn't a problem.=C2=A0 However, we will still need to evalu=
ate
the store, demographics, competition, etc to value the store to sell it as
well as go back and forth with clients to see the laundromat.=C2=A0 We
unfortunately cannot do all of that without our retainer fee.=C2=A0 Like I
said, I have a client who we built a store for last year who has family in
Princeton who is very interested in that area and would be a very strong
cash buyer.=C2=A0 Let me know your thoughts.

Thanks,
