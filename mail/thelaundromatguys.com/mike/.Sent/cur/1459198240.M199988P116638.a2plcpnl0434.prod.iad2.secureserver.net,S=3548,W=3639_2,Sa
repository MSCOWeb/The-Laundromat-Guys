Hello Mike,

Attached is our NDA, a questionnaire that we would appreciate you filling
out, and our consulting proposal if you wish to proceed with us. =C2=A0The
questionnaire will help us expedite things moving forward and gives us a
reference point as new locations come our way. =C2=A0Please review and feel
free to call me with any questions you may have. =C2=A0As I said in my text
earlier, we have 2 locations that may be a good fit for you, and we would
be able to see them this week if they interest you. =C2=A0Thanks for your
patience, it takes a lot of time and effort to find the right locations.

Regards,
Michael Settembre
