Hey John,

I changed the layout to what I feel will be the best mix of equipment  
and overall flow to the space.  Also, I attached a spreadsheet with  
the pricing of the equipment, card system, and capacity of the  
machines. This way if we need to make any adjustments you can see what  
the cost difference will be.  Let me know what you think and when you  
will be available to go see the Paterson store.  Thanks for the  
opportunity to try and earn your business and I'm confident that we  
can help you build a successful laundromat....with as little stress as
possible!!

Thanks Again,

Mike Settembre
