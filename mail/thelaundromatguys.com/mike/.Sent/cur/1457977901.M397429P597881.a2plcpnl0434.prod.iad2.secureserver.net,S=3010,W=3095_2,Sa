  Hello Fernando,

I got your message earlier today. =C2=A0I am working on finding a suitable
laundromat for you to look at. =C2=A0We try and do a lot of the analyzing a=
nd
legwork ahead of time to eliminate wasting any of our clients time. =C2=A0M=
any
of the laundromats that are available are just not worth wasting your time
on after we do our preliminary assessment. =C2=A0With that said, I am worki=
ng
on a few at the moment and if I think that they are worth looking at
further I will defintely discuss them with you. =C2=A0Feel free to call me =
