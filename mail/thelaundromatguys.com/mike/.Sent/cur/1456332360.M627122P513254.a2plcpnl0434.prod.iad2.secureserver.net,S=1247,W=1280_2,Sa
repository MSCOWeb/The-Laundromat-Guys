Hello Orlando,

It was a pleasure speaking with you earlier.  I have already reached  
out to a couple of my clients and they have interest in learning more  
about your store.  Are you able to send me whatever information,  
financials, etc., that you have so I can begin reviewing?  Then we can  
set up a time to meet with you and go over everything.  It will make  
things go a little smoother/faster if I can get started and do a  
preliminary analysis of your laundromat to see what we are working  
with.  Feel free to call me if you have any questions or need anything  
from me.

Best Regards,

Michael Settembre
