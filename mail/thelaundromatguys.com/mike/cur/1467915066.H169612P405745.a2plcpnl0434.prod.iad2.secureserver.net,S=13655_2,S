 Here are my problems with the draft.=C2=A0

 It does not account for the State programs. If i have to pay for a new HVA=

the assumption that the  goverment programs will be available post closing.=
 Al's draft does not account for that.=C2=A0
 =20
 Al, did you get Mike's email last night wherein he said all parities are i=
n agreement that the agreement between Orlando and Landlord has to referenc=
e certain work that is  subject to the NJ programs and all parties are oper=
ating on the assumption that such program will exist to offset the costs of=
 the lighting and HVAC? =C2=A0=20
 Your draft fails to account for that agreement as I assume Orlando was par=
t of "all parties agree". =C2=A0=20
  Paragraph 9 seems to directly conflict with the Landlords prior draft agr=
eement in that it limits Orlando's liability to only the work to be complet=
ed. If Orlando cannot or  does not want to agree that in the event of my un=
likely default to complete the work identified in schedule a, Orlando's ori=
ginal lease applies.=C2=A0=20
 According to John Sullivan, Orlando's agreement to the foregoing is a cond=
ition precedent to the landlord presenting me with a new lease.=C2=A0=20
 John, please advise if I'm incorrect relative to the above.=C2=A0=20
 Relative to the escrow funds, I will agree to hold funds in escrow relativ=
e to the alterations. I am not agreeing to Orlando's attorney holding such =
funds in escrow.=C2=A0=20
 I hope we can work this out. It appears that there is a disconnect on the =
seller's side. If we cannot make a deal today, then I am done. Orlando know=
s rhe parameters and if there is no draft which includes the above by today=
, I want my deposit back and Orla do can look for a new buyer, and you guys=
