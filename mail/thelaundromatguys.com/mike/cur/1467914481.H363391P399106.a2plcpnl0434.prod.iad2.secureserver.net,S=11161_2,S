I have  reviewed Al's draft, and its really a step back from John's draft 
and Mike's  email of last night.   


Here are my problems  with the draft. 


It does not account for  the State programs. If i have to pay for a new 
HVAc system within 120 days,  then forget it. All partiies are operating under 
the assumption that the  goverment programs will be available post closing. 
Al's draft does not account  for that. 




Al, did you get Mike's  email last night wherein he said all parities are 
in agreement that the  agreement between Orlando and Landlord has to 
reference certain work that is  subject to the NJ programs and all parties are 
operating on the assumption  that such program will exist to offset the costs of 
the lighting and HVAC?  


Your draft fails to  account for that agreement as I assume Orlando was 
part of "all parties  agree".  



Paragraph 9 seems to  directly conflict with the Landlords prior draft 
agreement in that it limits  Orlando's liability to only the work to be 
completed. If Orlando cannot or  does not want to agree that in the event of my 
unlikely default to complete  the work identified in schedule a, Orlando's 
original lease  applies. 


According to John  Sullivan, Orlando's agreement to the foregoing is a 
condition precedent to the  landlord presenting me with a new lease. 


John, please advise if  I'm incorrect relative to the above. 


Relative to the escrow  funds, I will agree to hold funds in escrow 
relative to the alterations. I am  not agreeing to Orlando's attorney holding such 
funds in escrow. 


I hope we can work this  out. It appears that there is a disconnect on the 
seller's side. If we cannot  make a deal today, then I am done. Orlando 
knows rhe parameters and if there  is no draft which includes the above by 
today, I want my deposit back and Orla  do can look for a new buyer, and you guys 
can do the same kabookie dance  again. 


Regards, Michael  Benenati
