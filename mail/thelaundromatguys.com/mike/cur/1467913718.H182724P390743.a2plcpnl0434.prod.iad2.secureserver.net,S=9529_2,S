I have reviewed Al's draft, and its really a step back from John's draft an=
d Mike's email of last night.=C2=A0
Here are my problems with the draft.=C2=A0

It does not account for the State programs. If i have to pay for a new HVAc=
 system within 120 days, then forget it. All partiies are operating under t=
he assumption that the goverment programs will be available post closing. A=
l's draft does not account for that.=C2=A0

Al, did you get Mike's email last night wherein he said all parities are in=
 agreement that the agreement between Orlando and Landlord has to reference=
 certain work that is subject to the NJ programs and all parties are operat=
ing on the assumption that such program will exist to offset the costs of t=
he lighting and HVAC? =C2=A0
Your draft fails to account for that agreement as I assume Orlando was part=
 of "all parties agree". =C2=A0
Paragraph 9 seems to directly conflict with the Landlords prior draft agree=
ment in that it limits Orlando's liability to only the work to be completed=
. If Orlando cannot or does not want to agree that in the event of my unlik=
ely default to complete the work identified in schedule a, Orlando's origin=
al lease applies.=C2=A0
According to John Sullivan, Orlando's agreement to the foregoing is a condi=
tion precedent to the landlord presenting me with a new lease.=C2=A0
John, please advise if I'm incorrect relative to the above.=C2=A0
Relative to the escrow funds, I will agree to hold funds in escrow relative=
 to the alterations. I am not agreeing to Orlando's attorney holding such f=
unds in escrow.=C2=A0
I hope we can work this out. It appears that there is a disconnect on the s=
eller's side. If we cannot make a deal today, then I am done. Orlando knows=
 rhe parameters and if there is no draft which includes the above by today,=
 I want my deposit back and Orla do can look for a new buyer, and you guys =
can do the same kabookie dance again.=C2=A0
Regards, Michael Benenati
