John, there are things that can be agreed upon right now without a draft be=
ing circulated. For example, neither Orlando or myself are willing to pay y=
our fee and revise schedule a to say either the HVAC system is replaced or =
is repaired to a working order.=C2=A0
If the LL agrees to those changes, I will draft something for ciculation. H=
owever, its a waste of time for us to draft something and spend hours, days=
 or weeks talking about it.=C2=A0
Kindly determine if the LL is on board with agreement that was contained in=
 Mike's email of yesterday, subject to reviewing the language in draft agre=
ement.=C2=A0
If so, send me your draft as a word attachment and I will revise and circul=
ate to Al and Orlando, then you.=C2=A0
I think the forgeoing is a better approach.=C2=A0
Kindly let me know if you disagree.

Rod- please advise John to amend the termination letter on the two points t=

  =20
   - =C2=A0Please attach Schedule A to termination letter to clarify "Tenan=

   - =C2=A0Language needs to be added stipulating that the 90 day time peri=

r in conjunction with the program, namely, the HVAC, lighting, and ceiling =
tiles.=C2=A0 All parties are under the belief that this program will be rei=

Please advise when these changes will be made as everyone is eager to move =
