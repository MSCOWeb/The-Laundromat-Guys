After speaking with Rod and all parties involved, I believe we have finally=
 resolved all of the issues at hand.=C2=A0=20

Rod- please advise John to amend the termination letter on the two points t=
hat we discussed:
  =20
   - =C2=A0Please attach Schedule A to termination letter to clarify "Tenan=
t's Work".
   - =C2=A0Language needs to be added stipulating that the 90 day time peri=
od refers only to work performed outside of the NJ Direct Install program o=
r in conjunction with the program, namely, the HVAC, lighting, and ceiling =
tiles.=C2=A0 All parties are under the belief that this program will be rei=
nstated in the near future, however, if I time frame needs to be establishe=
d, please allow 1 year.

Please advise when these changes will be made as everyone is eager to move =
forward.=20
