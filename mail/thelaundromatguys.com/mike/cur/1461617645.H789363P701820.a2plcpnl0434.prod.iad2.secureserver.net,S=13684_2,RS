Orlando is currently being billed for 70% of the water usage. As of =
Friday, April 23rd, the separate meters have been installed and we will =
be billing for actual usage going forward.

Subject: EZ Wash Newark

Hello Jeff,

Thank you for speaking with me the other day regarding the sale of EZ =
Wash in Newark.  Can you please provide me with the percentage of the =
water bill that Orlando is currently paying and when you expect to =
switch over to the submeters?  There are a few interested buyers, one in =
particular who I expect to make an offer as soon as I can give him an =
idea of what his rent terms will be.  Here is a little backround on the =
buyer and what i see his plans are for the laundromat:

- He is an attorney and a cash buyer.
- He will be offering somewhere arounf $250-350k for the business.
- Immediate expenses to get the laundromat where it needs to be will =
include but not limited to replacing (18) 20lb washers which are =
currently not working, repairing all out of order washers and dryers, =
cleaning/painting, new counter area, replacing light fixtures with LEDs, =
new signage inside and out, replacing ceiling tiles, etc.  I estimate =
the cost of the upfront work to be $125-$150k.
- The remaining washers/dryers are 13+ years old and will need to be =
replaced in the next 3-5 years depending on cost of repairs.  This will =
be inevitable as any equipment has a reasonable lifespan of 15-20 years. =
 Estimated cost of equipment alone will be in the $600-$700k range.
- Any buyer investing this amount of money is going to need a long term =
lease to protect their investment, as well as the equipment comany =
requires it in order to obtain financing.
- After analyzing the current net profit, including potential growth =
under new management along with improvements both cosmetically and =
equipment, the total rent for this store will need to be in the =
$7000-$8000 (total) range for it to make sense for the new tenant and =
ensure long term success.  This would equate to approx. $21-$24 sq. ft. =
in year one.
- Most investors will be looking for a minimum 10 year lease with 2 or 3 =
five yr options.

Thank you for your time and please let me know your thoughts asap as the =
buyer is anxious to move forward.

Rergards,
